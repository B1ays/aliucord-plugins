# EncryptDMs

Encrypts your dms

## How it works
DMs are encrypted and decrypted on both sides with the same AES-256 key. This AES-256 key is generated by one user, and then transfered to the other user securely using RSA public and private keys.

### Initial setup
1. Both users send their RSA public keys
2. Both users save the other's RSA public key
3. User 1 generates an AES-256 key
4. User 1 encrypts and sends the AES key with User 2's public key
5. User 2 decrypts the encrypted AES key with their private key and saves the AES key
6. Both users now have the AES key

### DM encryption
1. User 1 encrypts message with AES-256 key
2. User 1 encrypts the AES encrypted message with their RSA private key
3. User 1 sends encrypted message
4. User 2 decrypts message with User 1's public key
5. User 2 decrypts with saved AES key
